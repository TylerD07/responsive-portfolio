        "In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of
        chance, my
        head is bloody but unbowed. It matters not how straight the gate, how charged with punishments the
        scroll,
        I am the master of My fate, I am the captain of my soul." <br>

        - William Earnest Henley

        I believe liturature gives us a glimpse into the life of it's composer. I find value in this because I
        enjoy learning from other's expereicnes. When I read Henley's "Invictus" I can really resonate with the
        kind of person he is.
        When Henely refers to not wincing under the misfortunes of circumstance, he displays a quality of character
        that I believe we share: Positivity and drive. When life hits us hard there is one decision that controls
        the
        aftermath, our reaction.
        We can choose to get discouraged and become distraught or we can simply accept it, smile, and trust in our
        ability to prevail.
        I choose to trust in the fact that if I continue to strive and work hard everything will work out in my
        favor. Positivity goes a long way. A simple smile to a bystander can make their day. One good deed can
        save
        somebody from suicide. I try to be nice to everyone I encounter and spread love where ever I go. No
        matter
        how tough adversity gets I will always choose to have positve energy. By controlling my thoughts I can
        create my own reality. By focusing my mind on the joy of life and what drives me, I can dictate my destiny.
        After all we only get one life, why waste it being mad at things that do not go
        our way when we can embrace the beauty of life and enjoy every second as it passes?

        Im 22 years old and I live in Atlanta, GA. I enjoy the outdoors and exploring the city on my
        skateboard.
        Family and friends are very important to me. I chose to start a career in Web Development simply
        because I
        love technology but I also want to be able to provide for my loved ones and I believe the Technology
        Field
        is the key to the future. I chose not to bore you with random facts about my life and instead I gave a
        brief look of how my brain opperates. Thoughts are powerful, so I hope my insights about life are of
        benefit. Now that you have an idea of how I think, take a look at some of my work. I gaurantee
        you wont be disapointed.
